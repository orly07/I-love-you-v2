## üöÄ **Deployment**



To deploy this project, you‚Äôll need to deploy both the **client (frontend)** and **server (backend)** separately. Below are the general steps:

&nbsp;
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy the Client (Frontend)**

The frontend is built with Vite and can be deployed using platforms like **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)** or **[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)**.

- Ensure your entire project (including the client and server folders) is pushed to a GitHub repository.
- Ensure your updated codes are being pushed to github if you're using Automatic Deployment (From GitHub)
- Sign up for Vercel or Netlify.
- Connect your GitHub repository to the platform.
- During the setup, specify the `client` folder as the root directory for the frontend.
- Follow the deployment steps (usually automatic).
- Your frontend will be live at a provided URL.

&nbsp;

**For detailed instructions, refer to the official Vite deployment guide:**

üëâ [Vite Deployment Guide](https://vite.dev/guide/static-deploy.html)

&nbsp;

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy the Server (Backend)**

The backend is built with Express.js and can be deployed using platforms like **[Render](https://render.com/)** or **[Railway](https://railway.com/)**.

- Ensure your entire project (including the client and server folders) is pushed to a GitHub repository.
- Ensure your updated codes are being pushed to github if you're using Automatic Deployment (From GitHub)
- Sign up for Render or Railway.
- Connect your GitHub repository to the platform.
- During the setup, specify the `server` folder as the root directory for the backend.
- Add your environment variables (from `.env`) in the platform‚Äôs settings.
- Follow the deployment steps.
- Your backend will be live at a provided URL.

&nbsp;

**For detailed instructions, refer to the official Express.js deployment guide:**

üëâ [Express.js Deployment Guide](https://expressjs.com/en/advanced/best-practice-performance.html#deployment)

&nbsp;

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Update the API Configuration**
- Before deploying the server, ensure that you change the cors origin to your frontend domain.

```js
app.use(cors({ origin: "https://your-frontend-domain-example" })); //change this to your deployed frontend domain
```

- After deploying the server, update the `baseURL` in the `config.js` file to point to your live backend URL. For example:

```js
api: {
  baseURL: "https://your-backend-url.com", // Replace with your live backend URL
  sendEmailEndpoint: "/send-email",
},
```
And **re-deploy** your frontend / backend as needed after your changes

## üìú **Project Summary and Setup Guide**

### **Customization**

1. Everything is customizeable, modify the project in `config/config.js` in the frontend directory.

2. Ensure the `baseUrl` in the config matches your development port.

3. Verify that all `.env` variables are correctly configured and point to the intended resources

5. Test features during development **(e.g., Nodemailer should work even in development mode)**

### **Deployment**

1. Since the `frontend` and `backend` are in the same repository, you‚Äôll need to specify the correct folder **(client or server)** during deployment.

2. Deploy the backend first and confirm that it's running before updating the `baseUrl` in the frontend configuration

3. After deployment, thoroughly test all features and re-deploy as necessary to resolve any issues.
